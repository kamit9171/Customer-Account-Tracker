# Customer Account Tracker

## Project Overview

The Customer Account Tracker is a web-based application built using Spring Boot, Hibernate, Servlets, JSP, JPA, and MySQL. The main objective of this project is to create a system that allows performing CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on customer accounts. This system provides a simplified way to manage and manipulate customer data efficiently.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot:** We have used Spring Boot as the primary framework for building this application. Spring Boot simplifies the development of Java applications, providing a set of tools and conventions for rapid development.

- **Hibernate:** Hibernate is used for Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) to interact with the MySQL database, making it easier to work with relational data.

- **Servlets and JSP:** Servlets are used to handle HTTP requests and responses, while JSP (JavaServer Pages) is used for rendering dynamic web pages.

- **JPA (Java Persistence API):** JPA is used for managing the persistence of Java objects to the database. It provides a high-level, object-oriented interface for database operations.

- **MySQL:** MySQL is the chosen database system for storing customer account information.

## Features

- **Create Customer Account:** Allows users to add new customer accounts to the system.

- **Read Customer Account:** Provides the ability to view customer account details, including account information and transactions.

- **Update Customer Account:** Allows users to modify existing customer account information.

- **Delete Customer Account:** Allows users to remove customer accounts from the system.

## Testing

To ensure the functionality and correctness of the CRUD operations, we recommend using **Postman** for testing. Postman is a popular tool that allows developers to test API endpoints by sending requests and verifying the responses. You can use the following Postman collections to test the endpoints provided by this application:
